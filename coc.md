## Driving Principle

We want a positive experience for everyone in the community, regardless of:
- Gender
- Ability
- Age
- Sexual Orientation or Identity
- Ethnicity
- Religion
- Appearance
- Socioeconomic status
- Native Language
- Geographic Background

To ensure a welcoming and inclusive community we will prioritise the safety of the marginalised over the comfort of the privileged.

This code of conduct outlines what is and is not acceptable behaviour within our community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming, friendly and inclusive language
- Helping each other to broaden our knowledge and perspective
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Making fun of people for not knowing something
- Public or private harassment
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

The Community Relations Head is responsible for making sure that the Code of Conduct is enforced.
The Community Relations Head as well as the Core Committee have the right and responsibility to remove and reject any contribution of a community member who is found violating this Code of Conduct. The Core Committee may also temporarily or permanently ban any offender whose behaviour they deem harmful to the community.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all club interactions offline as well as online, and when an individual is representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of places of community interaction include all the club meet-ups and events, and the Official Slack Channel.
Examples of representing the community include official email addresses and social media accounts of the club.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Community Relations Head at raykar.ath@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
Members of the Core Committee who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the club’s leadership.

### Attribution
This Code of Conduct is loosely based on the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available [here](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html).
