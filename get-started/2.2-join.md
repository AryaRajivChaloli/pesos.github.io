Joining PES Open Source is easy â€” all you have to do is add your name to our members list in our [organisation repository]().

Here is how you do that:

1. Sign Up for a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account.
2. Go to our [members list repository]() and click on the **Fork** button on the top right.
3. Now in your fork, add your name and a little bit about yourself.
4. In your forked repository, click on the **New Pull Request** button.
5. In the right drop down, select your fork, and add a title and description for your pull request. Click on **Create Pull Request**.

That's it! ðŸŽ‰

Now all you have to do is wait for one of our maintainers to merge your Pull Request and you will officially be a part of PES Open Source!

> For those of you new to Open Source â€” congrats! You just made your very first Open Source contribution!

If you have any difficulties in joining, [reach out to us](/contact), and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
