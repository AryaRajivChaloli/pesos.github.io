Joining PES Open Source is easy â€” all you have to do is add your name to our members list in our [organisation repository]().

Here is how you do that:

1. Sign Up for a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account.
2. Go to our [members list repository](https://github.com/pesos/members-list) and click on the **Fork** button on the top right.
3. Now in your fork, add your name and a little bit about yourself.
4. In your forked repository, click on the **New Pull Request** button.
5. In the right drop down, select your fork, and add a title and description for your pull request. Click on **Create Pull Request**.

That's it! ðŸŽ‰

Now all you have to do is wait for one of our maintainers to merge your Pull Request and you will officially be a part of PES Open Source!

**VERY IMPORTANT**: Please join our Slack Channel [here](https://join.slack.com/t/pes-os/shared_invite/enQtNzE3MzI2MjU5NzY2LWNjMjgwMjJkNTJlMTljNzI2MTkxZWM0MTA1NDQ4M2NiNGI0MjA3YTgzYTAzMTkwMzBmZTdmOGQwNjdlNzc5YmY) after doing the above.  
Also download the Slack app and set the notification settings to "All new messages".  
**Do not forget to do this or else you will miss out on all our important updates!**.
