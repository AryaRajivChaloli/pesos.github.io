# Official website and community blog of PES Open Source

This website was created by Jekyll using the TeXt theme template.

### TODO
- [ ] Populate `/resources` with our communication channels, and links/guides about Open Source stuff
- [ ] Populate `/get-started` with a guide to what PES-OS is about, kind of like the blueprint but more engaging
  - Use the sidebar links as reference
- [ ] Change `about.html`
- [ ] Clean up the sample posts from the Blog page
- [ ] Get people to actually blog on this

### Contributing
- Collaborators, work on the `development` branch always. Master branch has to be absolutely stable.
- Rest of the world: Feel free to fork this, add your suggestions, and send a pull request after consulting the maintainers in the Issues page
