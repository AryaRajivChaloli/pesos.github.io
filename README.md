# Official website and community blog of PES Open Source

### TODO
- [ ] Populate `/resources` with our communication channels, and links/guides about Open Source stuff
- [ ] Populate `/get-started` with a guide to what PES-OS is about, kind of like the blueprint but more engaging
- [ ] Change `about.html`
- [ ] Clean up the sample posts from the Blog page
- [ ] Get people to actually blog on this
