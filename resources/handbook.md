This is like our constitution. This document determines how PES Open Source is governed.

## Mission

PES Open Source serves to facilitate technical skills and knowledge by contributing to, creating, critiquing, and advocating for Open Source Projects.

## What we want to address

Our community wants to learn to work collaboratively on Open Source Projects. By doing so we can learn valuable programming skills and gain exposure to real-world code and also get a sense of what it's like to work in a team.

Since Open Source contributions are public, they also help in building our résumés and improve our career prospects.

## Activities

- Workshops on the Open Source movement, software and technologies
- Presentations and Talks from prominent members of the Open Source Community
- Open Source student projects supported by the community
- A pull request challenge in the style of Hacktoberfest
- Regular general meet-ups for casual coding, exchange of ideas and planning

## How we communicate

- General meet-ups at the college campus after class hours
- [Slack channel]()
- [PESU Forums]()
- [Mailing List]()
- [Official GitHub Organisation]()
- [Website]()

## Code Of Conduct

The PES Open Source Code of Conduct can be found [here]().

## Organisational Structure

- The group will have a core committee which consists of the following roles:
    - **Club heads/Benevolent Dictators**:
    Their role is to coordinate all the activities and make sure that everyone else is fulfilling their duty. They have a final say in all decisions, but are expected to be benevolent and serve the needs of the community.
    - **Technical Heads**:
    They are responsible to manage all the technical aspects such as the website, the group projects and technical arrangements at events.
    - **Community Relations Head**:
    They are responsible for promoting events and reviewing code of conduct violations and other grievances by the community.
    - **Event Coordinators**:
    They are the backbone of all events, and are expected to handle registrations, logistics and timing of events.

### Succession

- An election will be conducted to determine a new Core Committee to take over for the next academic year. Each of the above roles will be determined by the majority vote of the community. We would be following [alternative vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) rather than a first-past-the-post system to ensure maximum community satisfaction.
  - Voting is **compulsory** for all members. Members abstaining from voting without a valid reason will be stripped of their membership.
  - Paper ballots will be used. (We would be open to experimental approaches like a blockchain-based voting application, if our community is up for making one ;) )
  - There will be an election committee formed by members chosen at random during our election meeting.
  - The counting will take place by the election committee members in the presence of all candidates standing for election and the winner will be determined.
  > NOTE: While we should ideally have a large enough active membership to be able to conduct an election, it may not always be possible especially in our first year since us restarting this group. In such a case the current Core Committee will select the next Core Committee and set a target to reach higher membership numbers that can at least sustain an election. The criteria for succession in this method will be only if we cannot get more one candidate on a role and if there is an estimated turnout of less than 30 votes.
- These roles are chosen before every even semester break and the last event organised before the break will be organised by the new committee under the mentorship of the old committee.
- This new committee will also conduct the meet-ups under the supervision of the old community.

### In case of dissatisfaction with the Club Head

- Any member can start a motion to impeach in a general meet-up. If more than 60% vote for impeachment on a turnout of over 80%, then fresh elections will be held to determine a new Core Committee. This new Core Committee will be effective immediately and will *not* be required to be mentored by the Old Committee as per the usual protocol.

## Resources

We currently have the following resources at our disposal:

- Seminar halls and College classrooms 
  
  The college campus is where most of our events and activities will be conducted. Being an official club, we get to use these spaces.
  
- Funding
  
  This is also provided by our college and the funding amount often depends on our performance and usefulness of our club.
  
- Equipment
  
  All the equipment needed for workshops and talks are also provided to us by our college.
  
Human Resource:

- Core Committee and Event Organisers
  
  They will be running the show. Members of the core committee will be selected based on interest and competence in their respective roles. The new core committee will be formed from the existing pool of members.
  
  The Core Committee members are also responsible for the budgeting and planning of events.
  
- Faculty-in-charge/Head of Departments
  
  They will be our contact point to help us work with the college in getting our activities approved and executed.
  
- Club Members
  
  They are the heart of our community, and everything boils down to their continued interest and participation. Becoming a member only requires a student to register, contribute and participate in our activities!

## Planning for the Future

At the end of each semester we will review all our activities we conducted and how it helped achieve our goals and targets and the problems it solved. This will allow us to gain insight into what worked in directly fulfilling our goal (as per the community assessment) and what did not work so well (Using the Red, Yellow, Green method would be useful here).

Based on the review we will modify our activities for the next semester in a way that will address our goals better.

At every even semester break the new leadership roles are assigned. Since the new team has already had the chance to organise the last few activities before the break, the continuity will remain.

A few metrics to measure success:

- Attendance of members in meetups, workshops and talks
- Number of GitHub contributions by club members
- Activity on the organisation repository
- Activity on the Slack channel
- Health of the group projects
