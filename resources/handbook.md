# The Official PES Open Source Handbook

This is like our constitution. This document determines how PES Open Source is governed.

## Mission

PES Open Source serves to facilitate technical skills and knowledge by contributing to, creating, critiquing, and advocating for Open Source Projects.

## What we want to address

Our community wants to learn to work collaboratively on Open Source Projects. By doing so we can learn valuable programming skills and gain exposure to real-world code and also get a sense of what it's like to work in a team.

Since Open Source contributions are public, they also help in building our résumés and improve our career prospects.

## Activities

- Workshops on the Open Source movement, software and technologies
- Presentations and Talks from prominent members of the Open Source Community
- Open Source student projects supported by the community
- A pull request challenge in the style of Hacktoberfest
- Regular general meet-ups for casual coding, exchange of ideas and planning

## How we communicate

- General meet-ups at the college campus after class hours
- [Slack channel]()
- [PESU Forums]()
- [Mailing List]()
- [Official GitHub Organisation]()
- [Website]()

## Code Of Conduct

The PES Open Source Code of Conduct can be found [here]().

## Organisational Structure

- The group will have a core committee which consists of the following roles:
    - **Club heads/Benevolent Dictators**:
    Their role is to coordinate all the activities and make sure that everyone else is fulfilling their duty. They have a final say in all decisions, but are expected to be benevolent and serve the needs of the community.
    - **Technical Heads**:
    They are responsible to manage all the technical aspects such as the website, the group projects and technical arrangements at events.
    - **Community Relations Head**:
    They are responsible for promoting events and reviewing code of conduct violations and other grievances by the community.
    - **Event Coordinators**:
    They are the backbone of all events, and are expected to handle registrations, logistics and timing of events.

#### TODO: Fix everything for the rest of this section (it's a mess as per my GitHub mentor)

#### Succession

- The roles of the new core committee will be appointed by the club heads who are graduating.
- The new roles are to be decided by those members who are retiring that role. For example a graduating Technical Head decides the new Technical Head.
- These roles are chosen before every even semester break and the last event organised before the break will be organised by the new committee under the mentorship of the old committee.
- This new committee will also conduct the meet-ups under the supervision of the old community.

#### In case of dissatisfaction with the Club Head

- This measure should be a last resort, but in case of overwhelming dissatisfaction of the community with the club head, they are allowed to fork the repository containing the code of conduct and mission statement and resume operations independently of the disowned club heads. New positions may be elected for the same.
- **Note:** This measure should be taken only if over 80% of the members express dissatisfaction with the leadership.

## Resources

We currently have the following resources at our disposal:

- Seminar halls and College classrooms 
  
  The college campus is where most of our events and activities will be conducted. Being an official club, we get to use these spaces.
  
- Funding
  
  This is also provided by our college and the funding amount often depends on our performance and usefulness of our club.
  
- Equipment
  
  All the equipment needed for workshops and talks are also provided to us by our college.
  
Human Resource:

- Core Committee and Event Organisers
  
  They will be running the show. Members of the core committee will be selected based on interest and competence in their respective roles. The new core committee will be formed from the existing pool of members.
  
  The Core Committee members are also responsible for the budgeting and planning of events.
  
- Faculty-in-charge/Head of Departments
  
  They will be our contact point to help us work with the college in getting our activities approved and executed.
  
- Club Members
  
  They are the heart of our community, and everything boils down to their continued interest and participation. Becoming a member only requires a student to register, contribute and participate in our activities!

## Planning for the Future

At the end of each semester we will review all our activities we conducted and how it helped achieve our goals and targets and the problems it solved. This will allow us to gain insight into what worked in directly fulfilling our goal (as per the community assessment) and what did not work so well (Using the Red, Yellow, Green method would be useful here).

Based on the review we will modify our activities for the next semester in a way that will address our goals better.

At every even semester break the new leadership roles are assigned. Since the new team has already had the chance to organise the last few activities before the break, the continuity will remain.

A few metrics to measure success:

- Attendance of members in meetups, workshops and talks
- Number of GitHub contributions by club members
- Activity on the organisation repository
- Activity on the Slack channel
- Health of the group projects
